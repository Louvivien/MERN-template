# M.E.R.N Template
This project is a composition of **MongoDB/Express.js/React.js/Node.js** Setup for any scaled startups or Hackathon. It also includes passport-jwt authentication and authorization. 

Great for anyone who wants to get started with their startup idea quickly and for those who are participated in Hackathons and save time on feature development rather than constructing a codebase.
